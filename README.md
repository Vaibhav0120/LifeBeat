# LifeBeat - Lung Cancer Detection & Health Companion

Welcome to **LifeBeat**, an innovative healthcare application that helps users detect a specific type of lung cancer using chest X-rays. LifeBeat simplifies healthcare by integrating advanced cancer detection technology and providing users with tools to book appointments with doctors.

The app was developed by the team **Error 404** during the **HackStreet Hackathon**, where we proudly secured the 2nd Runner-Up position. This README will guide you through the appâ€™s features, current functionalities, and our roadmap for future enhancements.

## Future Plans

1. **Expanding Disease Detection**
   - Enhancements to our TFLite model will allow LifeBeat to detect additional types of diseases beyond lung cancer.
   - Continuous improvement in detection accuracy and expanding the scope of healthcare services.

2. **Chatbot Integration**
   - A smart chatbot will be integrated to suggest doctors based on users' symptoms, providing a personalized and guided experience.

3. **Pharmacy Integration**
   - LifeBeat will include a pharmacy section, enabling users to order medicines directly through the app. This will create an all-in-one healthcare platform, eliminating the need for multiple apps.
